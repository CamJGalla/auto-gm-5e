# Auto GM 5E

## About
The intent of this Foundry module is to provide tools for automatically running certain aspects of monsters. Any given creature can be assigned certain automation triggers, causing it to behave according to board state and knowledge about other elements on the table.

Individual pieces can be automated, such as movement, attach prioritization, ability selection, or item usage. Or, more comprehensive "personalities" can be assigned to a given creature, setting each tweakable value for the GM.

For the most technical users and those interested in playtesting encounters, a more honed-in approach is possible as well, tweaking individual values such as a creatures Survivability Index or Aggression Towards Squishies. Tweaking these values may result in eratic monster behavior, but with a fine enough hand applied, highly specialized creatures can be created and custom personalities can be saved. With enough effort, emulating a player's behavior can be done.

**** Please note: At the moment, this module is undeveloped, untested, and unusable. This is largely experimental and not intended for general use. Install at your own risk. ****
